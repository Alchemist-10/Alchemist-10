# Hi 👋

## I'm **Akshay VS**

> Machine Learning & Data Science enthusiast • Full‑Stack developer • Problem solver

I'm a Computer Science student passionate about **machine learning, data science, and building production‑ready full‑stack applications**. I enjoy turning data into insights, training models that solve real problems, and shipping web services that make those models useful to people.

I focus on practical ML (data preprocessing, model building, deployment) while keeping strong engineering foundations (APIs, databases, containerization). I'm always learning — currently experimenting with scalable ML pipelines and model interpretability.

### 🔭 What I'm working on

- Building an end‑to‑end ML pipeline for a real‑world project (data ingestion → training → deployment)
- Improving my LeetCode problem solving and system design skills
- Creating full‑stack projects that showcase model inference in web apps

### 🌱 Currently learning

- Advanced ML topics: model explainability, MLOps, transformers
- Scalable backend systems and cloud deployment
